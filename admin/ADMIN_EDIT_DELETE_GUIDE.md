## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### **Issue: Edit/Delete Buttons Not Visible**

**Check:**

1. **Table loaded properly?** - Should see products listed
2. **Admin authenticated?** - Make sure you're logged in
3. **Console errors?** - Press F12 → Console tab

**Fix:**

- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors

### **Issue: Edit Modal Not Opening**

**Symptoms:** Clicking edit button does nothing

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check console** (F12 → Console):

   ```
   Look for: "🔄 Editing product: [ID]"
   Should see: "✅ Product form populated for editing"
   ```
2. **Check ProductManager**:

   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   console.log(productManager);
   console.log(productManager.products.length);
   ```

**Fix:**

- Refresh page to reinitialize ProductManager
- Check if products loaded: should see product count in sidebar

### **Issue: Edit Modal Opens But Form Empty**

**Symptoms:** Modal opens but fields are blank

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check console for errors**:

   ```
   Look for: "❌ Error populating form"

   ```
2. **Check product data**:

   ```javascript
   // Find a product in browser console:
   console.log(productManager.products[0]);
   ```

**Fix:**

- The form population should work automatically
- Check if product has all required fields (name, price, etc.)

### **Issue: Update/Delete Not Saving**

**Check:**

   ```
   Look in console for: "✅ Product updated in Firebase"
   ```
3. **Network errors**:

   ```
   Check Network tab in browser dev tools
   ```

**Fix:**

- Restart auto-sync server: `npm run auto-sync`
- Check Firebase credentials in `firebase-config.js`

### **Issue: Delete Confirmation Not Showing**
